    <h2>How Okonomiyaki Gained Importance to Us</h2>
    <p>Getting to know each other from a distance posed its challenges, so we saught out unique and interesting ways to stay engaged. One of our favorites was cooking. We tried ample different recipes over the years, but one of our utmost favorites, and the first meal we ever cooked together in person was Okonomiyaki. We used <a href="https://www.justonecookbook.com/okonomiyaki/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Just One Cookbook</a> as our reference, and have since used their website countless times. We've grown to enjoy the mood setting music tied to each video, played countless times to get whichever recipe were following right, we admire the skill and just how adept/informative Nami is, and we have even entered into a little cooking contest ourselves!</p>
    <p><strong><em>Here is to many more recipes together, and likewise, hopefully, many more HTML files</em></strong></p>
